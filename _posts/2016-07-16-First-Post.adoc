:hp-tags: HubPress, AsciiDoc

Trying out HubPress. +
No idea how AsciiDoc works just yet.

link:https://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[This] seems like a good cheatsheet for AsciiDoc syntax.

.This is a title
NOTE: The note icon is not rendering.

.Another title
TIP: Neither is the tip icon.

=== Themes
I tried the link:https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/tree/master/themes[themes] available. +
Here's how they look.

==== Casper
The note and info icond didn't work as you can see below. +
But the theme itself looks okay.

==== Ichi
This one really works when you have a lot of posts and need a sidebar navigation.

==== Roon
Not too shabby and I think the homepage looks quite good. +
Maybe I'll use this.

==== Saga
Maybe this needs some customization. +
Something to experiment later. Much later.
