= Installing lxml

:hp-tags: lxml, python, macos
Turns out installing lxml involved a few steps on my Mac OS (El Capitan) 10.11.6

1. `xcode-select --install`
2. Update Xcode from the App Store (It's under the ï£¿)
3. `sudo xcrun cc` and type agree at the end of the document
4. Finally a `pip install lxml` worked
5. Then `brew install libxml2` followed by
6. `brew link libxml2 --force`

All this of course in a conda environment or a virtualenv
