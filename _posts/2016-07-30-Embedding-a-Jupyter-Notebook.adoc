= Embedding a Jupyter Notebook

:hp-tags: Jupyter, HubPress, AsciiDoc

Thanks to link:https://iacchus.github.io/[@iacchus]'s link:https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/issues/406#issuecomment-235481873[instructions], I was able to embed a Jupyter Notebook into a post.

Of course, it should be a lot easier than creating a gist, but it's a livable workaround for now :)
