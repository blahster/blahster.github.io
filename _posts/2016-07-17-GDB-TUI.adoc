:hp-tags: gdb

I had no idea GDB had an link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses[ncurses] interface!

video::PorfLSr3DDI[youtube]

The video shows, among other interesting features, how to use TUI (terminal user inteface). +
After gaping at the video I Googled for GDB TUI and found link:https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/TUI.html[this]. +
In particular, the link:https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/TUI-Keys.html#TUI-Keys[keyboard shortscuts] are most useful.
